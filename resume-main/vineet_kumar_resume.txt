### Work Experience

**Senior developer**
*INRO*, Montreal, QC, Canada
December 2014 - present (2.5 years)

- Contribute to research and development of Emme and CityPhi.
  Emme is a travel demand modelling system for transportation forecasting.
  CityPhi is a visual analytics software for large-scale spatial and mobility
  data.

- Wrote a new compiler and memory management system for Emme's matrix
  calculator language. Achieved up to 30x faster performance. It is efficient
  even for computations on large matrices (over 1 GB).  (C++ and Python)

- Data analytics for GTFS and transit smart-card data: Developed techniques and
  tools to visually analyze and query public transit data.  These tools are
  used by clients to analyze and query things like loads, delays, and stop
  activities. (Python)

- Designed and built Cityphi's data import backend and API to import geo and
  transport data from various formats like Shapefiles, OSM and GTFS.  Also work
  on optimizing and extending the core data backend. (C++ and Python)

- Designed and developed new Python API modules for Emme's Fortran backend.

**CTO and co-founder**
*ISENCORE Technologies*, Montreal, QC, Canada
September 2013 - December 2014 (1 year 3 months) 

- Implemented the 3D object discretization module for Quirdity, ISENCORE’s 3D
  simulation engine (bit.ly/discretizer). (C++)

- Won first prize in the Mcgill Dobson cup 2014 startup competition.

- Delivered the winning pitch to get selected as one of the 20 startups
  worldwide to present at SLUSH 2014.

**Research and teaching**
*McGill University*, Montreal, QC, Canada
January 2012 - April 2014 (2 years 3 months)

- Research Assistant, Sable Lab - My research included program analysis and
  static compilation of dynamic languages.

- Designed and developed MiX10 : a Matlab to X10 compiler for high-performance,
  under Prof. Laurie Hendren’s supervision and with direct inputs from the X10
  design team at the IBM T.J. Watson research center. (Java)(bit.ly/getmix10)

- Achieved 7 times (mean) faster performance compared to the standard Matlab
  implementation.

- Discovered 2 bugs and a severe performance bottleneck in the X10 compiler.

- Teaching Assistant - Program Analysis and Transformations, Compiler Design,
  and Introduction to Computer Systems.

**Systems engineer**
*Infosys Technologies Ltd.*, Pune, India
September 2008 - August 2011 (3 years)

- Led a team of 4 for deployment performance management for AT&T’s online and
  mobility frontend and backend applications.

- My team’s job was to design and develop performance test scripts, analyze
  results, and troubleshoot performance issues.

- Worked on 8 projects and they all exceeded performance SLA under peak loads.

**Student Tech Lead / Campus ambassador, APAC region**
*Sun Microsystems*, Bangalore, India
January 2007 - May 2008 (1 year 4 months)

- Promoted from being one of the only 27 Campus Ambassador across India to one
  of the only 5 Tech Leads worldwide.

- Taught a course on OpenSolaris at the university. Conducted webinars and
  developed tutorials for ambassadors worldwide.
